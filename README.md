## Preprocessing for Input Features

All of the code required for preprocessing the input features is located in the `preprocessing` folder. Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:

1.  Downloading the Needed Dataset
2.  Separating out Justin Verlander's Games
3.  Finalizing the Dataset

The `main.py` script was an early attempt to contain this all in a single script, but for quick iteration and bug fixing, we moved to Jupyter Notebooks.

## Model Training

The `model_training` folder contains all of the model experiments that we ran. Most of the experiments are divided into different Jupyter Notebooks, depending on the model and hyperparameters specifically being trained and tested.

## Relevant Papers

The `RelevantPapers` folder contains some of the key papers we cited in our report, including some others that are interesting but did not directly influence our paper.

## Data

The `data` folder contains relevant datasets for the report. The `VerlanderOnly` datasets were the datasets we ended up using for the final report.
